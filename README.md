# GPT-from-scratch

A personal project implementing a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model from the ground up. This project aims to deepen understanding of transformer architectures, language modeling techniques, and the training process behind Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on high-level frameworks or pre-built architectures.

## Features

- **Transformer Architecture**: Implements encoder-decoder or decoder-only transformer blocks, multi-head attention, positional embeddings, and layer normalization as described in the original GPT papers.
- **Tokenization and Data Loading**: Includes custom code for tokenizing text and preparing input sequences, ensuring a fully end-to-end pipeline.
- **Training from Scratch**: Demonstrates how to train a GPT-like language model from raw text corpora, covering forward pass, loss computation, backpropagation, and parameter updates.
- **Configurable Hyperparameters**: Adjust model size, number of layers, hidden dimensions, learning rate, and other training parameters to experiment with different setups.

## Why Build a GPT from Scratch?

Implementing GPT from scratch offers a hands-on way to:

- Understand the fundamental building blocks of transformer-based language models.
- Learn how attention mechanisms contribute to state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks.
- Gain insights into optimization challenges, dataset preparation, and model evaluation.
- Experiment with custom modifications to the architecture or training loop to see their impact on model performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch (recommended for GPU acceleration)
- [Optional] CUDA-compatible GPU for faster training

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aravindpadman/GPT-from-scratch.git
   cd GPT-from-scratch
   ```
   
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, you may need to manually install packages such as `torch` and `numpy`.

### Usage

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**:  
   Place your training corpus (a large text file) under a `data/` directory or specify its path in the training script.
   
2. **Training**:  
   Adjust hyperparameters (like batch size, learning rate, or model depth) in the training script, then run:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path data/your_text_corpus.txt --epochs 5
   ```
   This will train the model on the provided text corpus.

3. **Sampling / Generation**:  
   After training, use the trained model weights to generate text:
   ```bash
   python generate.py --prompt "Once upon a time"
   ```
   The script will produce a continuation of the prompt using the trained model.

## Customization

- **Model Dimensions**: Modify the transformer dimensions, number of heads, and layers in `model.py` to experiment with model capacity and performance.
- **Training Loop**: Adjust the learning rate scheduler, optimizer, and gradient clipping in `train.py` to improve convergence and stability.
- **Tokenization**: Swap out the current tokenizer logic in `data.py` for a more sophisticated approach like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or use a pretrained tokenizer.

## Roadmap

Future improvements and potential features:

- Add support for a pretrained tokenizer or more advanced tokenization strategies.
- Implement gradient accumulation and mixed-precision training for faster convergence and reduced memory usage.
- Integrate evaluation metrics (e.g., perplexity) to track training progress and improvements.
- Add support for prompt engineering and conditional generation.
